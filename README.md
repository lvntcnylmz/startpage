### Weather

wttr.in API is used for weather information. For more details: [wttr](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in)

To get the weather information for your city, simply replace the parameter in the `getWeatherData()` function on line 13 of the `index.html` with the city you want.

Example: `getWeatherData('Clausthal')` => `getWeatherData('New York')`
